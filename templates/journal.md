# Thomas's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Git and the command line and reading about the history FOSS and design principles.  I was already familiar with the command line, so spent the time working on upgrading my laptop's drive to an SSD.  Time was also spent on a work project invol

*Hour 1: Spent the time figuring out how to clone an harddrive in Linux.  Found out about "rsync" which seems very useful
*Hour 2: Cloning a harddrive in Linux seemed overly complicated, so I did a clean install and began setting up software needed (laptop is for class)
*Hour 3: Read *Decoding Liberation*
*Hour 4: Started reading *The Design of Design*
*Hour 5: Reviewed Git using the DHRI Git tutorial, looked into VS Code as a editor to use
 

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

This week I started learning how to use python.  I've done a tutorial before, but didn't remember much of it

*Hour 1: Installed Anaconda, set up a lesson folder, and started *Learn Python3 the Hard Way*, started with excersice 0 and looked at the different types of text editors online 
*Hour 2: Did excercises 1-6, played around with the Study Drills too, didn't run into any problems
*Hour 3: Did excercises 7-11, added played around with input() with some older excercises
*Hour 4: Did excercises 12 & 13, played around with inputs and modules a bit


## Week Four (2/14 to 2/20)

This week I continued *Learn Python3 the Hard Way*

*Hour 1: Did excercise 14, started playing *Zork* got 15 points and killed by the troll in the basement. Did actually think about how the commands and prompts were structed to make the game work.
*Hour 2: Did excercise 15, including "Study Drills," ran into some problems figuring out how to get the script to work with input() and including close().  Realized I could change an older script I had to convert excel to XML, but then realized this was written in python 2 and decided  to save that project for later. Did excercise 16.
*Hour 3: Did excercise 17, spent most of the time figuring out how to get the code down to one line. 
*Hour 4/5: Did excercises 18-21, stopped before doing ex21 study drills.

## Week 5 (2/21 to 2/27)

More python

*Hours 1&2: I took the python2 script I had to convert Excel sheet into indivudual XML files so it would work in python3.  At first it worked, but then noticed a lot of fields were missing.  After running it a few times I realized I was missing the code to write those specific fields. Got that working, but the "Date" field kept not showing up.  After a whole lot more poking around, I realized Python wasn't reading the Date column, because the column was listing the dates as dates, not as plain text. This led to some reformatting in Excel and now the files are exported correctly. The remaining issue is a "Traceback ....." error because the script reads past the last row and is hitting blank "Filename" cells or reading a column too far.  Will investigate more later.
*Hour 3: Set up Jekyll.  Installed it the basic way first and nothing worked, then I found the better and more detailed instructions and got it all up and running
*Hour 4/5ish: Worked on Python3 The Hard Way, did ex22 which has you write down and list every command so far.  I found this very useful since I realized I forgot a bunch of things.
*Hour 5ish?: Worked on a topic modeling project using Mallet, but this time instead of using RStudio to melt and reform the data, I used pandas in python to create the final excel doc.
