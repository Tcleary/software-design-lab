# Call for Programmers

The Center for Public History has received a grant to create an app for our New York City Oral History initiative.  We are now looking for developers to create an app that lets people record and publish Oral Histories of themselves, family friends, the guy from the corner store, etc., and make them public on our website. The app will also allow users the option to upload things like photos and documents that help flesh out their stories, and the ability to handle sure that we have all the right permissions and legal .  Not only will this help build the historical record, but also give people a chance to record and organize their own personal collections to share with friends and family online on the center’s website.

Since we are receiving government funds and to keep in the spirit of transparency and in making information available, all source code will be make public and instructions created to give other organizations the chance to use this tool in their own project.  Due to the state of the GLAM field and the constant technology and resource gap, for the app to be effective, it will also need to be lightweight and simple to set up.

**General requirements that the app needs:**
* An app to take audio and/or video recordings 
* To record personal information (person’s name, date, location, contact information, etc)
* Ability to upload photos and documents that would be associated with the interviews
* A “Rights Management” ability that gives the interviewees a chance to assert their copyright and personal privacy
* Ability for the user to organize interviews for personal collections
* A public facing website that will provide public access to the interviews.
* Ability for the app to be lightweight, so it can work with limited IT resources.
